					<h3>How-to Use:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Type your message into the input</li>
						<li>Click on the output</li>
						<li>Copy text</li>
					<ul>
				</div>
				<div class="inline">
					<h3>What is this for?</h3>
					<p>
						This is intended for people who would like to post content
						without it being indexed by search engines (whether on
						social media, or otherwise). It's mainly to serve as a
						safeguard for people to speak freely without having to
						worry about people targeting them for specific key terms,
						such as civil rights movements or mentioning names of
						predators on social media.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="inline">
					<h3>How does it work?</h3>
					<p>
						This tool allows you to generate text using both cyrillic
						and greek characters, which look very similar to the English
						alphabet. This gives the benefit of making text normally
						readable, and preventing key terms from being easily
						searchable.
					</p>
					<p>
						Do keep in mind that this isn't fool-proof; your generated
						text <i>will</i> be indexed, just not under the normal
						text. This is mainly to just prevent results under dragnet
						filters.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="inline">
					<h3>Does this send any data?</h3>
					<p>
						Nope! The data you input on this page isn't sent anywhere.
						However, it does require javascript enabled in order to
						work.
